# 'ALBUMS'

My first React-Native app - this ios/android app allows users to browse an artist's albums, and follow a link to purchase those albums online.

## Skills & Competencies Demonstrated

* React-Native project creation and setup (including ESLint)
* React components and state
* Use of additional packages, i.e. axios

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo.
2. Install react-native.
3. Install the repo-specific dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the app in an emulator with `react-native run-android` or `react-native run-ios`.  Be sure to reference the [React-Native ReadMe](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/README.md) for information.
