# 'ALBUMS'

My first React-Native app - this app utilizes axios to showcase an artist's top albums.  This project covered many of the key requirements of app development, namely:
* Project creation and setup (including ESLint)
* App navigation
* Components and state
* Feature integration, in this case axios

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo.
2. Install react-native.
3. Install the repo-specific dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the app in an emulator with `react-native run-android` or `react-native run-ios`.  Be sure to reference the [React-Native ReadMe](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/README.md) for information.
